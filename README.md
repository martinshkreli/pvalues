Input your own estimates of the simufilam results to see if the p-value would be met. Keep in mind this is not an ANOVA/ANCOVA type test, which is likely what will be used.

In general, an effect size of 1.5 points will likely be statistically significant. Anything less than that rapidly has no chance of being S.S.
